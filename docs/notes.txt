installs
  - sudo apt-get install isc-dhcp-server
Network
  - configured eth0 to be static 10.42.0.7 (using ubunutu network configurations, file /etc/network/interfaces)
  - configured the network to be shared, 
  - do not think needing ip_forwaring (/etc/sysctl.conf or sudo sysctl -w net.ipv4.ip_forward=1)
  - configured the dhcpd to lease addresses starting at 10.42.0.10 ( see file /etc/dhcp/dhcpd.conf)
  -    ( ensure that router is set to the  static ip_address)
Login
  - start the dhcpd

  looking at itfanatic.com/?q=node/84 for dhcpd.conf
  changed name-server to 192.168.0.1 ( sKy router)

sudo dhcpd

  - first check the ip address, see what dhcp leases there are in the file /var/lib/dhcp/dhcpd.leases
  - following command will allow login if using the ip address 10.42.0.80

 sshpass -p raspberry ssh pi@10.42.0.80

 Modified the adafruit example, downloaded from github (git clone https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit-RasPipe.git)
 Files modfied , flask_listener.py ( added a dummy RasPipe class as not interacting with TFT) 
                 also uses the templates index

## Setup for cross development
  - see http://hertaville.com/2012/09/28/development-environment-raspberry-pi-cross-compiler/
sudo apt-get install build-essential git
  - download the cross compile git clone git://github.com/raspberrypi/tools.git
  - located in /home/skelly/wkspace/rasppi/tools
  - install GPIO module for the raspberry Pi
sudo apt-get install python-dev python-rpi.gpio

## copied raspian card form sd

  - Copied

sudo dd if=/dev/sdb of=raspbian20160911.bin

  - Wrote to new disk( pv allows to monitor progress)

sudo dd bs=1M if=raspbian20160911.bin | pv | sudo dd bs=1M of=/dev/sdb
